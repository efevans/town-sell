Add a Rucksack that limits how many items the player carries. The game should indicate to the player when their rucksack is full, so they know why they can't buy an item. When trying to buy an item while the rucksack is full, there should be a feedback to the player that the cause of not being able to buy is the maxed rucksack. This may be accomplished by having the capacity of the rucksack in the bottom left, and playing an animation when a max size rucksack is the cause of not being able to gain more items. For player enjoyment sake, it may be good to allow players to go over the size if they gain an item indirectly, like from a quest

Fail
------
Add a timer the player must get through the gate by (F: Took too much screen. Instead, maybe have clocks around town that are displaying time)
Add an Inui sprite to the game as an NPC and animate it (F: Sprite does no look good with the kenney tileset. Her proportions do not match the other humans, and she has too many dark colors in her image that don't allow a good looking outline)
